                        biggest take away for me was the open-heart discussions. I found great comfort knowing that a
                        man of your education and work history, feels the workplace "sting" of how sometimes office
                        politics can affect oneself. Also, your gentle nature and the suggestions you gave us.
                        In addition, the other students shared their stories and now I don't feel alone in this.”.</p>
